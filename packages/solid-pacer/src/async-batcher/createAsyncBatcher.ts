/**
 * Creates a Solid-compatible AsyncBatcher instance for managing asynchronous batches of items, exposing Solid signals for all stateful properties.
 *
 * This is the async version of the createBatcher hook. Unlike the sync version, this async batcher:
 * - Handles promises and returns results from batch executions
 * - Provides error handling with configurable error behavior
 * - Tracks success, error, and settle counts separately
 * - Has state tracking for when batches are executing
 * - Returns the result of the batch function execution
 *
 * Features:
 * - Configurable batch size and wait time
 * - Custom batch processing logic via getShouldExecute
 * - Event callbacks for monitoring batch operations
 * - Error handling for failed batch operations
 * - Automatic or manual batch processing
 * - All stateful properties (items, counts, etc.) are exposed as Solid signals for reactivity
 *
 * The batcher collects items and processes them in batches based on:
 * - Maximum batch size (number of items per batch)
 * - Time-based batching (process after X milliseconds)
 * - Custom batch processing logic via getShouldExecute
 *
 * Error Handling:
 * - If an `onError` handler is provided, it will be called with the error and batcher instance
 * - If `throwOnError` is true (default when no onError handler is provided), the error will be thrown
 * - If `throwOnError` is false (default when onError handler is provided), the error will be swallowed
 * - Both onError and throwOnError can be used together; the handler will be called before any error is thrown
 * - The error state can be checked using the underlying AsyncBatcher instance
 *
 * ## State Management and Selector
 *
 * The hook uses TanStack Store for reactive state management. The `selector` parameter allows you
 * to specify which state changes will trigger a re-render, optimizing performance by preventing
 * unnecessary re-renders when irrelevant state changes occur.
 *
 * **By default, there will be no reactive state subscriptions** and you must opt-in to state
 * tracking by providing a selector function. This prevents unnecessary re-renders and gives you
 * full control over when your component updates. Only when you provide a selector will the
 * component re-render when the selected state values change.
 *
 * Available state properties:
 * - `errorCount`: Number of failed batch executions
 * - `executionCount`: Total number of batch execution attempts (successful + failed)
 * - `hasError`: Whether the last batch execution resulted in an error
 * - `isExecuting`: Whether a batch execution is currently in progress
 * - `items`: Array of items currently queued for batching
 * - `lastError`: The error from the most recent failed batch execution (if any)
 * - `lastResult`: The result from the most recent successful batch execution
 * - `settleCount`: Number of batch executions that have completed (successful or failed)
 * - `successCount`: Number of successful batch executions
 *
 * Example usage:
 * ```tsx
 * // Default behavior - no reactive state subscriptions
 * const asyncBatcher = createAsyncBatcher(
 *   async (items: Item[]) => {
 *     const results = await Promise.all(items.map(item => processItem(item)));
 *     return results;
 *   },
 *   {
 *     maxSize: 10,
 *     wait: 2000,
 *     onSuccess: (result) => {
 *       console.log('Batch processed successfully:', result);
 *     },
 *     onError: (error) => {
 *       console.error('Batch processing failed:', error);
 *     }
 *   }
 * );
 *
 * // Opt-in to re-render when items or isExecuting changes (optimized for UI updates)
 * const asyncBatcher = createAsyncBatcher(
 *   async (items: Item[]) => {
 *     const results = await Promise.all(items.map(item => processItem(item)));
 *     return results;
 *   },
 *   { maxSize: 10, wait: 2000 },
 *   (state) => ({ items: state.items, isExecuting: state.isExecuting })
 * );
 *
 * // Opt-in to re-render when error state changes (optimized for error handling)
 * const asyncBatcher = createAsyncBatcher(
 *   async (items: Item[]) => {
 *     const results = await Promise.all(items.map(item => processItem(item)));
 *     return results;
 *   },
 *   { maxSize: 10, wait: 2000 },
 *   (state) => ({ hasError: state.hasError, lastError: state.lastError })
 * );
 *
 * // Add items to batch
 * asyncBatcher.addItem(newItem);
 *
 * // Manually execute batch
 * const result = await asyncBatcher.execute();
 *
 * // Access the selected state (will be empty object {} unless selector provided)
 * const { items, isExecuting } = asyncBatcher.state();
 * ```
